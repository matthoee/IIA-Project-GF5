# GF5: Animating 3D Characters

## Motivation

Animated characters look magical, but the core ideas are concrete:

- a surface that looks like a person or creature
- an internal skeleton that gives it structure
- motion data that says how the body changes over time
- rendering choices that make the result readable

The project studies those pieces directly, starting with a block character
where the hierarchy is visible before moving toward human-avatar scenes.

## What This Project Is About

Build a small character-animation pipeline, then use it to create an animated
human-avatar scene.

This project studies a simple version of the character-animation pipeline:

1. represent a character as a skeleton and a mesh
2. pose the skeleton with forward kinematics
3. attach a surface to that skeleton with skinning weights
4. turn a sequence of poses into a short animation

The emphasis is on understanding the mechanics of animation, not on learning a
large authoring package.

## Four-Week Shape

| Week | Mode | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Individual | Implement and debug forward kinematics on a simple block character. |
| Week 2 | Individual | Implement and compare one-hot skinning and linear blend skinning on SMPL. |
| Week 3 | Pairs | Explore human motion clips and reconstruct group-member characters. |
| Week 4 | Pairs | Refine the group animation scene and export the final video. |

## Intro Slides

Open the [hosted intro slides](../slides/intro.md) for the first session. The
Notes panel works on the hosted page; notes are cached in the browser on that
device.

To keep your own notes as a Markdown file in the project folder, run this from
the repository root:

```bash
python3 slides/serve.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8095/intro.html`. Your notes are saved to
`slides/student_notes/intro_notes.md`.

To rebuild the same HTML locally, run `python3 docs/build_site.py` and then
`python3 slides/build_slides.py`.

## Assumed Background

You are expected to be comfortable with:

- basic Python
- vectors and matrices
- reading and modifying small codebases

You are not expected to have prior experience with:

- 3D graphics
- rigging
- animation software
- SMPL or human-body models

Before running the viewer, create the Python environment from the shipped
`env.yml` file.

## Why The Project Starts With A Block Character

The early parts use a blocky articulated character rather than a realistic
human mesh.

That is deliberate. A block character makes the hierarchy easy to see:

- each body part is rigid
- each joint is easy to identify
- FK bugs are visually obvious

Once the skeleton logic is clear, we switch to SMPL and study mesh deformation.

## Project Parts

### Part 1

Focus:

- joint hierarchies
- local versus world transforms
- forward kinematics
- key poses and timeline-based motion authoring

See [Part 1](part1.md) for the exact coding tasks, required outputs, and the
part-1 material that must be prepared for the interim report.

### Part 2

Focus:

- rest pose
- skinning weights
- one-hot skinning
- comparison with linear blend skinning (LBS)
- motion reuse on SMPL

See [Part 2](part2.md) for the exact coding tasks and implementation
requirements.

### Part 3

Focus:

- later group character-animation work building on the same FK and skinning
  pipeline
- final brief and deliverables to be released after the interim checkpoint

The Part 3 brief is not part of the current Parts 1 and 2 release. Use the
[Part 3 placeholder](part3_placeholder.md) for release status.

## Interim Checkpoint

At the end of Part 2, you should have enough material for an interim report.

The exact required content, figures, videos, code submission, and report
structure are defined in the relevant handouts:

- [Part 1](part1.md) for the part-1 material you must carry forward
- [Part 2](part2.md) for the skinning tasks and evidence you need to collect
- [Interim Report](interim.md) for the complete report and submission
  requirements

## Use Of AI Tools

For Parts 1 and 2, do not use AI tools to generate your submitted code, derive
the core math for you, or generate your results.

For Parts 3 and 4, you may use AI tools as part of the creative or production
workflow. The focus is still to create a realistic, controllable 3D avatar
rendering scene and to explain how your group produced it.

For both reports, do not use AI tools to generate the report content wholesale.
Minor grammar, wording, or formatting help is allowed, but the explanation,
figures, results, and interpretation must be yours.

Every report must include an `AI Use Statement` saying either `No AI tools
used`, or describing the limited use you made of AI tools.

## Main Files

The core teaching code lives in:

- `viewer/asset_viewer.py`
- `viewer/motion_sequences.py`
- `viewer/skeleton_profiles.py`
- `viewer/smpl_support.py`

The viewer is used throughout Parts 1 and 2 for:

- skeleton inspection
- pose editing
- timeline authoring
- skinning-weight visualisation
- video export

It also provides the starting point for Part 3 motion preview and evidence
export where appropriate after the later brief is released.
