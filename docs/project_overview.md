# GF5: Animating 3D Characters

## Motivation

Animated characters look magical, but the core ideas are concrete:

- a surface that looks like a person or creature
- an internal skeleton that gives it structure
- motion data that says how the body changes over time
- rendering choices that make the result readable

The project studies those pieces directly, starting with a block character
where the hierarchy is visible before moving toward human-avatar scenes.

### AI Rigging & Neural Layer

## What This Project Is About

Build a small character-animation pipeline, then use it to create an animated
human-avatar scene.

This project studies a simple version of the character-animation pipeline:

1. represent a character as a skeleton and a mesh
2. pose the skeleton with forward kinematics
3. attach a surface to that skeleton with skinning weights
4. turn a sequence of poses into a short animation

The emphasis is on understanding the mechanics of animation, not on learning a
large authoring package.

## Assumed Background

You are expected to be comfortable with:

- basic Python
- vectors and matrices
- reading and modifying small codebases

You are not expected to have prior experience with:

- 3D graphics
- rigging
- animation software
- SMPL or human-body models

You will use practical tools such as a Python environment, terminal commands,
and Git, but you can learn those on demand. Start with [Setup](setup.md) for
the course environment, and use the [Git starter](references.md#useful-materials)
if cloning, committing, pulling, or pushing is new to you.

## Four-Week Shape

| Week | Mode | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Individual | Implement and debug forward kinematics on a simple block character. |
| Week 2 | Individual | Implement and compare one-hot skinning and linear blend skinning on SMPL. |
| Week 3 | Pairs | Explore human motion clips and reconstruct group-member characters. |
| Week 4 | Pairs | Refine the group animation scene and export the final video. |

## What You Will Build

The project has three technical parts and two report checkpoints. Parts 1 and
2 are individual coding tasks; Part 3 is a paired group animation project that
uses the same animation ideas in a more open production setting.

### Part 1

Focus:

- joint hierarchies
- local versus world transforms
- forward kinematics
- key poses and timeline-based motion authoring

See [Part 1](part1.md) for the exact coding tasks, required outputs, and the
part-1 material that must be prepared for the interim report.

### Part 2

Focus:

- rest pose
- skinning weights
- one-hot skinning
- comparison with linear blend skinning (LBS)
- motion reuse on SMPL

See [Part 2](part2.md) for the exact coding tasks and implementation
requirements.

### Part 3

Focus:

- human motion clips and reconstructed group-member characters
- multi-character scene planning and motion composition
- final video export and group report evidence

See [Part 3](part3.md) for the group brief, final deliverables, and technical
backbone. The [Scene Editor Manual](scene_editor.md) gives the practical guide
to the Part 3 composition tool.

## Slides

Slides are generated from Markdown sources in `slides/` and appear under the
website's `Slides` dropdown.

For example, open the [Parts 1&2 slides](../slides/parts12.md) for the first
two sessions, then use the [Part 3 slides](../slides/part3.md) for the group
project. The Notes panel works on the hosted page; notes are cached in the
browser on that device.

To keep your own notes as a Markdown file in the project folder, run this from
the repository root:

```bash
python3 slides/serve.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8095/parts12-slides.html`. Your notes are saved
per deck under `slides/student_notes/`, for example `parts12_notes.md`.

To rebuild the same HTML locally, run `python3 docs/build_site.py`,
`python3 slides/build_slides.py`, and
`python3 slides/build_slides.py --source slides/part3.md --output site/part3-slides.html`.

## Use Of AI Tools

For Parts 1 and 2, do not use AI tools to generate your submitted code, derive
the core math for you, or generate your results.

For Part 3, you may use external tools, AI tools, custom assets, and your own
changes to the provided tools as part of the creative or production workflow.
The focus is still to create a realistic, controllable 3D avatar rendering scene
and to explain clearly how your group produced it.

Every report must include an `AI Use Statement`. In the interim report, state
either `No AI tools used`, or describe any limited non-substantive use such as
spelling checks or environment/setup help. For the final Part 3 report, state
either `No AI tools used`, or describe which AI tools you used and what you used
them for. The report must still accurately explain your workflow, evidence,
results, and interpretation.

## Main Files

The core teaching code lives in:

- `viewer/asset_viewer.py`
- `viewer/motion_sequences.py`
- `viewer/skeleton_profiles.py`
- `viewer/smpl_support.py`

The viewer is used throughout Parts 1 and 2 for:

- skeleton inspection
- pose editing
- timeline authoring
- skinning-weight visualisation
- video export

It also provides the starting point for Part 3 motion preview and evidence
export.
